      "There is a widely held belief in basketball that some players have periods of time where they are much better shooters than normal.  This can be called having a \"hot hand\".  An example would be if a player hit 3 shots in a row, then many fans would expect that player to be more likely (than their usual percentage) to hit their next shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether this is a real effect or some kind of cognitive bias has been previously studied.  For instance in 1984(83?, 85? FIX THIS), [RESEARCHERS] looked at actual shooting results of the Philadelphia 76ers, free throws of the Boston Celtics, and controlled-experiment shots of college students.  Their data did not support the existence of a hot-hand effect.  This question has been revisited, for instance in [PAPERS FROM 2005?? or so??] which also failed to find evidence to support the existence of the hot-hand effect.  Interestingly, in 2015 [RESEARCHERS] noted that the sampling method used in previous studies was flawed.  The flaw is subtle, but leads to some evidence for the hot-hand effect.\n",

I have downloaded all shooting data for 2016-2017 and placed it in the files nba_savant_<month>_<year>.csv in the data/nba_savant folder.  [Note: you can ostensibly download a .csv file of the shots data for the entire year, but the files seem to be limited to 50,000 lines which is not enough.  That's why I split the data by month when downloading.]\n",
